# knights-path

A program that finds the shortest path a knight can take between two points on a standard 8x8 chessboard

## unstructured thoughts

- js is convenient & familiar
- ts - let's have some annotations!
- microbundle
- jest
- node >=8
- run with npx
- zero dependencies
- classes + modern code, but commonjs
- bfs (generate all good next moves per level) + runmin path combo?
- ok but what of first principle reasoning, can I do this without graphs?
- extensible
- generic within reason (e.g. re: board size)
- min test structure with examples in task (obs: there can be more than 1 shortest path of the same length)
- write docs + sense-check with someone else (leo?)
